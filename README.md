# CameraX Guide - Expiration Date Checker

An Android application that helps users check product expiration dates using camera recognition technology. The app provides both automated date recognition through the camera and manual entry options for maximum flexibility.

## Features

- üìÖ Scan and recognize expiration dates on product packaging of Eucerin products
- ‚úèÔ∏è Manual date entry option when camera recognition is challenging
- üì∏ High-quality photo capture using CameraX API
- üîç Text recognition powered by ML Kit
- üîÑ Switch between front and back cameras
- üí° Toggle camera flash/torch for better scanning in low light
- üé® Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose
- üì± View captured scans in an integrated gallery


## Main Functionality

This application serves as an expiration date checker with dual input methods:

1. **Camera Recognition**: Point your camera at a product's expiration date and the app will automatically detect and process the date information using ML Kit's text recognition capabilities.

3. **Manual Entry**: If the camera has difficulty recognizing the date or if you prefer manual input, the app provides a simple interface to manually enter expiration dates.
